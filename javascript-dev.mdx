Yesterday I was updating my old PC and I'd accidentally corrupted some files. So now, I have only two options left for me either reset my PC and lose all my data or hack into my PC and get my files backed up, I chose the second option and started my hack night. I tried every possible solution but nothing worked, at last, I picked up a new approach.

I remember this from my Linux class that we can install ubuntu on a portable mode with the help of a USB drive without creating any partition and existing modification to disk files. 

I created a bootable USB drive, plugged it into my PC and lit the OS with ubuntu. After booting it asked me if I wanted to try it before installation and hell yeah I answered that and moved one step closer to my recovery hunt. With that going on I just have to sneak into the filesystem and check for the partitions. You can use this

    
    cd /media
    

and there you go I have all my data in front of my eyes waiting to be rescued. I grabbed my mini weapon to safely transfer all the data from HDD to my portable rocket missile aka Pendrive and Hurray I have successfully executed this operation, thanks to askubuntu and my linux classes but wait why I'm telling you all this.

Yeah, you guessed it right, If you have closely investigated my rescue operation you'll notice that while recovering my data I used a portable OS running on my USB which accidentally opened the doors to access data of any locked device by just inserting a USB stick to the system. Isn't it cool how you can turn your rusty blunt knife into a deadly katana.

By the way, I'm still talking about that old Pendrive which I only used for exchanging private data from my not so private PC.
